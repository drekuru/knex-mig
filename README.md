Roadmap:
`mig seed run`

-   Add support for -a, -b, and numeric value params

`mig seed make <name>` - Create a new seed migration (should give user option to create .json or .js file)
`mig setup` - Setup the migration environment (should create a .mig folder in the root of the project, as well as help them initialize the .env file)
`mig whoami` - Show the current user (should show the current user that is logged in) (can be used with `mig ping`)
make colors in pp. consistent
